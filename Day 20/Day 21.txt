Images in Flutter:

1. Asset
2. Network
3. File
4. Memory

Asset:

Assest bundle is a collection of file,font, etc.
Part of the application not from the internet
Flutter build these bundles together 

Asset Bundle:

AssetBundle in Flutter acts like a centralized repository that stores all the static assets required by the application. 
It allows users to bundle together the different types of media content like icons, images, audio files, fonts, JSON data, etc into a collection and access them when the app is run.

The AssetBuilder not only makes the application development process smoother but also optimizes the application's performance. 
It also enhances the user experience, making it visually more appealing and user-friendly.

We can accessed using constructor or AssetClass(AssertImage)

Asset has various properties:

height,width,color,alignment,repeat  - ImageRepeat(repeatx,repearty,repeatNone)

ErrorBuilder : it takes call back function it maintains the application to maintain or avoid error

The Network image can also take the property of the assets images also

Navigator:

The Navigator widget is used to manage routes (i.e., screens/pages) in a stack-like manner. 
It helps in navigating between different pages of the app â€” like pushing a new screen onto the stack or popping the current one off.
