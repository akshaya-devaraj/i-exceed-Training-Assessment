🌐 Node.js with Express (Backend)
✅ What is Node.js?
A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.

Used to build scalable, non-blocking, and event-driven server-side applications.

✅ What is Express?
A minimalist web framework for Node.js.

Helps handle routing, middleware, requests, and responses easily.

✅ Common Tasks with Express:
Set up REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Connect to databases (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.).

Serve static files or handle file uploads.

Handle authentication and sessions (JWT, OAuth).

Validate input and manage errors.

📱 Flutter (Frontend)
✅ What is Flutter?
A UI toolkit from Google for building natively compiled apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

Uses Dart language.

✅ Why Flutter?
Fast development with hot reload.

Custom, beautiful UI.

Strong performance (compiled to native ARM code).

🔁 Node.js + Flutter Integration
✅ Communication Flow:
Flutter (client) sends an HTTP request (via http package).

Node.js/Express receives the request, processes it, accesses the DB, and sends a response.

Flutter parses the response and displays data in the UI.

✅ Use Cases:
User authentication (/login, /register)

Product listings (/products)

Placing orders (/order)

Payment processing

Chat/messaging (using Socket.IO for real-time)

🔐 Data Format
Most data is exchanged in JSON format.

Flutter uses jsonEncode and jsonDecode.

Express uses res.json() to send responses and body-parser (or built-in JSON parser) to read incoming JSON.

🔧 Development Setup Overview
🖥 Backend (Node.js + Express):
Set up routes: GET /products, POST /login, etc.

Connect to database (e.g., MongoDB with Mongoose).

Start server on a port (e.g., localhost:3000).

📱 Frontend (Flutter):
Make HTTP requests to backend (e.g., http.get(Uri.parse("http://localhost:3000/products"))).

Handle responses and map to Dart models.

Build UI widgets to show data.

🌍 Deployment
Node.js backend: Host on services like Render, Heroku, Railway, or a VPS.

Flutter app: Publish on Play Store, App Store, or host as a web app using flutter build web.
