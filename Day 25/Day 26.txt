âœ… Steps to Make API Calls Using http in Flutter:
Add http dependency in pubspec.yaml.

Run flutter pub get to install the package.

Import http and dart:convert in your Dart file.

Define the API endpoint URL using Uri.parse().

Use HTTP methods:

http.get() for fetching data

http.post() to send data

http.put() to update/replace data

http.patch() to update part of the data

http.delete() to delete data

Add headers (e.g., Content-Type) when needed, especially for POST/PUT requests.

Use jsonDecode() to convert JSON string response to a Dart map.

Use jsonEncode() to convert Dart map to a JSON string when sending data.

Wrap API calls in try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and errors.

Check response.statusCode to determine success or failure of the request.

Use a data model to convert JSON data into Dart objects (recommended for structured data).

Integrate with UI using FutureBuilder, state management, or controller callbacks.
