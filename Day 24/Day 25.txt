JSON:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

🔍 What is JSON Parsing?
JSON parsing means converting a JSON-formatted string into a language-specific data structure—like an object in JavaScript, a dictionary in Python, or a map in Java.

Likewise, JSON serialization (or stringifying) is the reverse: turning a data object into a JSON string.
