Isolates:

Dart is a single threaded languages.To over come this isolates are used using the messgae passing.

An Isolate is Dartâ€™s version of a thread â€” it has:

Its own memory

Its own event loop

No shared state with other isolates

Unlike threads in some languages, Dart does not support shared memory between isolates. Instead, isolates communicate via message passing (like SendPort / ReceivePort).

isolate.spawn():

Isolate.spawn() is a Dart method that creates a new isolate (i.e., a separate thread of execution) and runs a function in it.

ðŸ§  What Does spawn() Do?
Creates a new isolate (like a lightweight thread)

Runs a top-level or static function in that isolate

Optionally passes a message (usually a SendPort) to that function

Allows the spawned isolate to send messages back using SendPort

âœ… Benefits of Isolate.spawn()
Parallel execution â€“ utilizes multiple CPU cores

UI stays smooth â€“ isolates don't block the main isolate

Full control â€“ you manage ports, lifecycle, and communication

Can run forever â€“ good for background services or loops
