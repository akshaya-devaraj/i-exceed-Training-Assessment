Flutter :

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google, used for building mobile, web, and desktop applications from a single codebase.
It allows developers to create visually appealing and high-performance applications for multiple platforms
including iOS and Android, using the Dart programming language. 

Features:

Cross-platform development:
Flutter allows developers to build applications for multiple platforms (mobile, web, desktop) using the same code, saving time and effort. 

Natively compiled:
Flutter compiles application code to ARM or Intel machine code, providing native performance. 

Declarative UI:
Flutter uses a declarative UI approach, where the UI is defined based on data, making it easier to manage and update. 

Widget-based:
Flutter provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets, which are building blocks of UI, making it easy to create complex user interfaces. 

Hot reload:
Flutter's hot reload feature allows developers to see changes in their app instantly as they code, speeding up development. 

Dart programming language:
Flutter is powered by the Dart programming language, which is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
