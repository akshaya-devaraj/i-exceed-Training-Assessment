The dart program use to type of compiler to run the code
Just In Time Complier(JIT) is used for faster compilation
The Ahead-Of-Time(AOT) compiler is used for compliation during the depolyment of the entire program

const:

The const keyword is known as compile time constant that can be retained throughout the program
It can be acheived during the compile time

final:
The final keyword is executed during the run-time operations
These can be used in both compile time and run time

`const`: Used for creating compile-time constants, which are evaluated and determined at compile time. 
`const` values must be known at compile time and cannot change during runtime.
`final`: Used for runtime constants, meaning they are assigned a value at runtime but cannot be changed after that point during program execution.

Functions:

1. Positional Parameters:
      
	  It represent the passing the values to the parameters.
	  It needs only passing the values to the function.
	   

2. Named parameters:

       The named parameter in which the arguments are passed with names that are used according to the scenario
	   
	   
3. Named with default parameter:

       The named with default parameter contains the arguments are passed and we can able to provide them with default value
	   
4. Named with required parameter:
    
	    The required Keyword is passed so that it necessary to pass the argument
		
5. Optional position parameter:

        The specific block must be enclosed with the square bracket
		The default parameters can be passed
