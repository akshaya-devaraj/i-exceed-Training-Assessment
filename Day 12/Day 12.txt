OOPS classes and objects:

The dart programming supports both the functional and object oriented programming 
It is used according to the paradigm which means it is the mindset of the developer.

class consists of 4 componenets:

1.Class varaiables of instance varaiables which is declared above the constructor or methods

2.Constructor - The constructor allocates the memory to the object 

3.Methods - the methods can be used and can be altered according to the needed 

4.objects - It plays a major role in calling the class Which is used to access the methods and varaiables of the classes

The _ is used declare the varaiables as private and known as convertion of public to private.
In this the varaiables can be accessed within the library and not within the class.

The getters and setters are used to acheive Encapsulation
The get keyword is used in the getter function to avoid the function 

Constructor:

The constructor is used to allocate memory to the object.
The parameterized constructor cannot be passed in dart similar like java

The named constructor is used to pass the values with parameter

The extension:
the extension keyword is used to extend without the class
we can able to perform without the extensionClass name
